# DominosMiku
In the vein of projects such as PokeEmerald, a decompilation of Pokemon Emerald, why not attempt to decompile the C# source code of The Domino's App: Feat. Hatsune Miku?

How would this be possible though? Its a compiled binary. See, from what I can tell, the app uses C# and mono to run. That means it can be disassembled and eventually reverted back into its original source code. The app does appear to use unity, which may make it more difficult, but its possible, at least in theory.

Other than that, the UI of the app is rendered using HTML of all things. If nothing else, the UI could be restored to its original glory and viewed in any web browser.

***Note***: This might not even be feasible. This is really just for the lols, and to see if it *can* be done.
